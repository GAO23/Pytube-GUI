# Pytube-GUI
This is a GUI YouTube downloader using pytube and PyQt5 as the underlying API.
I am almost finish. I just need to add the user guide and the ability to let user to enable parallel downloading or not.

TO DO
* Implement the functionlaity to allow user to chooser between whether to download videos in parallel or not.
* Compile this application to a windows .exe executable after all of the above are finish. Linux users will need to pip install pytube, pyqt5, and run the main.py in my project folder with python 3.
