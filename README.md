# Pytube-GUI
This is a GUI YouTube downloader using pytube and PyQt5 as the underlying API.
To run my program:
If on Windows, run the Pytube-GUI.exe, if on Linux, run the Pytube-GUI binary, both can be found in my main project directory. 

# The .exe executable and Linux binary are both outdated and currentely defunct. Binary needs to be recomplile or you can run the python file directly by running "python3 Main.py". I will push an update in the future, as soon as I can get life out of the way.
