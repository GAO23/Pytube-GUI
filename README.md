# Pytube-GUI
This is a GUI YouTube downloader using pytube and PyQt5 as the underlying API.
Basic functionalities all work now. If you just want the most basic GUI that can download, this is already finished.

TO DO
* Implement the progress bar so user can know what percentage of the video remain to be downloaded. 
* Implement some much needed multithreading. Right now my program will freeze until all the videos are finished downloading lol.
* Compile this application to a windows .exe executable after all of the above are finish. Linux users will need to pip install pytube, pyqt5, and run the main.py in my project folder with python 3.
