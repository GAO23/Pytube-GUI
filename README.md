# Pytube-GUI
This is a GUI YouTube downloader using pytube and PyQt5 as the underlying API.
To run my program:
If on Windows, run the Pytube-GUI.exe, if on Linux, run the Pytube-GUI binary, both can be found in my main project directory. 

# The .exe executable and Linux binary are both outdated and currently defunct. Binary needs to be recomplile with the newest version of pytube APIs. I will make an update to get this working properly, as soon as life gets out of the way. In the mean time, use the pytube API directly.
